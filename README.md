### What I learned

- connecting with api by the help of fetch was awesome for me.But i still have some problem with fetch api I mean how to fetch data from server into my react application.I think I need to focus on this topic for my upcoming project.
- This is also my first time with tailwind CSS. Tailwind css is awesome I like their utility class it's save a lot of time for building application.I also need to enhance my skills on Tailwind by building other projects
